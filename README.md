# Predicting-Heart-Disease-Risk

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading world health problem, meaning that they occupy the dominant place among the causes of deaths. The necessity of early diagnosis and treatment as well as psychological help in regimen of treatment during heart disease cannot be underestimated. Predictive modeling by machine learning algorithms, has proven to be the most desirable and reliable method to predict whether a person may eventually suffer from adverse consequences. These models are performed by analyzing a variety of health indicators and historical data to predict heart related complications that may occur in the future. The development of predictive models with the precision required to allow for early-stage prediction, preventive care, personalized application of therapeutic interventions as well as proper resource allocation is an important step towards a more successful medical approach for the treatment of heart diseases. 

Here, we deal with the predictive analytics of heart disease applying to a dataset from a Kaggle platform. This will consist of preprocessing the data, feature engineering, and machine learning model training to actualize a predictive model which is robust enough for risk identification. Evaluation metrics will show the extent of its practical implementations, which would contribute to preventive health care and relying on data-driven decisions when handling medical conditions like heart diseases.

Objectives 
a)	Risk of cardiac disease based on patient demography and medical indicators.
b)	Identify what gives the major risk factors for coronary heart disease.
c)	Formulate an efficient machine learning model which categorizes the patient under either high-risk or low-risk category.
d)	Use evidence-based data to inform care providers' decision-making activities and resource allocation.
e)	Models valid and interpretable in the healthcare application environment to be trusted.
